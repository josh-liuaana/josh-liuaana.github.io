            Owning a business means making some ethical decisions on a pretty frequent basis. But the main ones are deciding on whether the success/profit of the business is a higher priority than wellbeing of staff. I liked to take the road of training employees who would quite often be on the younger side or in their first jobs so guiding them was more important that focusing on profitability. Taking money without properly processing the eftpos etc. could've been seen as a major misconduct but taking the time to sit down with employees to ask why money was taken lead to understanding issues at home which could then be worked out with help and although what they did was worthy of HR action not escalating things helped with the mentals of staff and in the long run taught them more than getting suspended or fired. Taking $5 here and there from cash bags etc
The culture I was raised in has always lead me to put family (and friends) first. This lead to Loyalty and Integrity being pretty important core values for me, people being honest and holding themselves accountable. A quote I heard from a coach when I was young and one I have used is "the name on the back of the shirt should never be more important than the badge on the front" perfectly describing that the success of the team is more important than individual pride. This is a pretty cool life lesson that can be taken into any team situation, both sporting and in the working environment. As long as the joint goal is achieved then it doesnâ€™t matter if some people have bad days etc

A strength for me is my ability to work hard, I'm not afraid of long hours or serious grinds. However this can also be limitation for me as I have been prone to thinking that working 12 hour days is healthy. Learning to find the balanced between efficient work and long hours is a focus of mine, and something I will look to continue working on as I progress through my career. Problem-solving has been a strength for me, being able to approach tasks logically and break any issues down to find a solution
A limitation that I have always had is being a bit of a perfectionist. It may be a competitive nature but I always want to be as proficient in anything I do. This can cause me to get very frustrated at a task that I may be struggling in which tends to make situations worse.
I believe that with a good combination of hard work and problem solving abilities, any learning situation can be tackled successfully. Taking a step back will help for more trivial tasks and being able to grind it out will help for the more tedious situations

Working in and managing a team always has an obstacles and in certain instances people can have quite differing skill steps and processes. Working in hospitality for so many years has providing many of these experiences where clashes can occur. When creating different products during different times of the day sometimes the speed of work can greatly impact the success of a shift. Some people are better in high stress situations and some who tend to take more time due to wanting a perfect product can cause tense working relationships. These situations required me to understand these different methods and assign people in roles best suited to their skillsets to best benefit the team as a whole. By taking a step back and identifying how people operate I could put the faster people in the roles which required higher output and then place the perfectionists at the end of the chain to quality check. That way everyone is in a happy position without stepping on each other's toes.
A similar technique works for most team environments, everyone has differing strengths and weaknesses and identifying these is important to operating efficiently. In situations when stress maybe isn't as high you can be more flexible with learning and teaching people different roles etc. but when the going gets tough sometimes its best just to play to your strength
