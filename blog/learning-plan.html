            What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?
My long term is to find a rewarding career where I can contribute positively to a product and workforce. In terms of a career pathway I would like to gain the skills and knowledge that I can be versatile and valuable.
A description of your own strengths and limitations in relation to learning
A main strength is the ability to work hard, however this is also a limitation as I can sometimes be quite reserved in my learning and prefer to focus on certain tasks alone. When learning new and somewhat tedious skills I like to go into my own zone and use my own problem solving skills to figure out how to do something new. That is not to say I am bad in a team but I treasure the moments when I can just put on some music and just work away by myself. I am not afraid of hard work and I enjoy the challenge of learning something new, however at times I can get frustrated when I don’t fully understand a concept and I am learning different ways to approach these frustrations, and coming to terms with not being proficient in everything certainly helps the learning process.
What skill (non-technical – human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?
Working with a variety of different people with a variety of different strengths is something that excites me, but I would love to become better at working in different environments when I am not in control and becoming comfortable in that zone. My last career I was the manager and therefore I was always in the same role. I would love to be able to take on new roles where I am reporting to new people, working at all levels of a project.
Another main skill I would love to develop is to be a bit more outgoing in a group project. I will usually stay relatively quite in an environment, until I get to a stage where I am confident in performing anything at a high level. Sounds pretty counterintuitive given I used to manage a Pizza Shop but I have always struggled putting myself and my ideas forward and would be ideal if I could learn to be a bit more confident in those environments
A commitment to how you will manage your workload. This should include
•	An explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other learners, facilitators and industry/community representatives
•	What you will do when things are building up and starting to get to you
Managing workload is vital element to a successful work life, and especially when working in a team where a commitment is made. For me personally I need to focus on not overdoing it or overpromising on what I can deliver. Understanding that I am still learning basics and knowing my own limitations is key, that way I can never underdeliver on what I can do. Following the time boxes is key for during foundations as this is a good base line. But moving forward I need to be able to look at a project and create these time limits myself to make sure I’m managing workloads effectively
When things get a bit tough, I need to learn to take a step back and revisit problems with a clearer mind, rather than slogging away unnecessarily.
A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way
I always try to solve problems myself first, by exploring the skills I already know, looking up documentation or researching something. Quite often beginning this process will provide a solution just because I am thinking of things in a more methodical way. This will be my initial step, but if I feel like I am still stuck then talking to peers is a really good way to seek help, it also helps to discuss these concepts with other learners as it helps solidify their learning as well. I prefer to try and find a solution myself first but not taking too long on this step will ensure time isn’t being wasted for no reason. Working to these timeboxes will help to understand how long a task should take before needing help from someone else
A description of what you expect from the facilitation team
Its all in the name really, they are there to help facilitate learning not be the driving factor behind it. Having given us most of the materials needed to learn new skills, the role isn’t entirely to teach, but more to give us tools in learning how to discover things ourselves. I don’t always want to be told an answer if I am stuck but more pointed in the right direction. Someone who is there for catch ups and just to make sure I am on the right path is all I am expecting. 
Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things
I am confident that I will be able to manage any external commitments well, I would like to think I am at a stage where time management is a good skill. My only main commitments are night activities, and I am trying to get into a really good routine of getting my work done during ‘office hours’ and as someone who has worked nights all my life it can be a push some days. But hopefully it’s a skill I can master so when I end up out the other end of DevAcademy looking at jobs it’ll be second nature.
