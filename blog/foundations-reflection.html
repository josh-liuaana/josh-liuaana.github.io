        <h4>
            What are three new things you learnt about yourself and your ego as a result of the core learning?
        </h4>
        <p>
            The first thing I learnt was that I am not perfect, and there is absolutely nothing wrong with that. 
            Even though I never thought I was perfect I always had very high expectations in myself and this idea of perfection was always something I sought. 
            By accepting that perfection in this industry is virtually impossible, and just learning and enjoying the process makes things much easier and will ultimately lead to a more enjoyable learning and work experience
        </p>
        <p>
            Identifying the way I think was so important to learning new skills. Having more freedom during this course and being able to learn in your own ways was really effective
        </p>
        <p>
            A final thing is that I learnt that I have to learn to adjust the way I listen to people. By listening and interpreting first before trying to offer anything else is really important to hearing what someone is saying, and then making sure I understand it.

        </p>
        <h4>
            What are the roles of Values, Empathy and Self-Awareness in learning and programming>
        </h4>
        <p>
            I believe that values and empathy are important in learning as it leads to a much healthier relationship with your peers. And in an industry that is team heavy understanding this is vital. Being aware of how you fit int an environment and understanding how you empathy towards others values and vice versa lead to successful work environments
        </p>
        <h4>
            What has surprised you the most about the core learning?
        </h4>
        <p>
            The main thing that surprised me was its relevance and how it made learning more enjoyable. When I initially thought of development, I still had the dark room hacker visions and it really encouraging to see that this is not the case and making sure the emotional skills are valued. Having worked in teams for a while now I feel like a positive work environment is the most valuable asset to a successful product
        </p>
        <h4>
            What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?
        </h4>
        <p>
            The most challenging aspect would be having to articulate these feelings. I have never been in a situation where I had to talk about emotions and values and although I was confident in understanding, having to explain things was new
        </p>
        <h4>
            Why do you think that we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development bootcamp course?
        </h4>
        <p>
            Developers already work with computers, the last thing the industry needs are emotionless robots writing those programs. The tech industry is pretty fresh and new so making sure that students are understanding more of the human factor is vital.
        </p>
        <h4>
            Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practise programming instead? Justify your answer.
        </h4>
        <p>
            None of the core activities took up too much time, and it was a nice break from the programming to take a step back and understand what I was doing and whether I was actually enjoying it. By reflecting on everything we did it reinforced the reasons behind things and made me actually look forward to working in a team, when in the past ive become a bit reclused in tougher situations, but talking to people through the listening exercises was a genuinely fun experience. It made me miss being apart of a team and getting to know and understand those around me.
