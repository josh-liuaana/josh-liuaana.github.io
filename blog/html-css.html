                    The Box model is a guide that lays out the different elements,
                    although similar in appearance and function there are quite a few differences.
                    As you can see it the image there a 4 main areas to consider:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Margin</li>
                        <li>Border</li>
                        <li>Padding</li>
                        <li>Content</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>

                <p>The easiest way to look at the Box Model concept is to break the element down into its 4 distinct sections</p>
                
                <h4>Content</h4>
                <p>The element content is the HTML content that you want to display on the page. Even though this in theory could just be empty space, this is where paragraphs or images live.
                    I like to think of the analogy of a house to explain the Box Model simply. Consider a person inside their house as the Element Content
                </p>
                <h4>Padding</h4>
                <p>
                    The next element we need to consider is the Padding. The Padding sits in the space directly outside the Content.
                    Sitting within the given element it creates the space bettwen the content itself and the border. A simple way to think of this is to continue out house analogy.
                    The space within the given room is the padding, a person stands within this room and the amount of space until you get to the wall is considered padding 
                </p>
                <h4>Border</h4>
                <p>
                    Next in the Box Model we have the border, and this area is the boundary between the padding and the margin
                    Once againthe element acts as a seperator, but this is the outline of the padding, which creates the boundary between the internal (padding) and external (margin) elements.
                    When we consider our house anaglogy the border is the walls of the house. It is a seperation created between the inside and outside of the house.
                </p>
                <h4>Margin</h4>
                <p>On the external of the Box Model we have the margin. An easy way to consider the margin is that it is a buffer region seperating the content from other elements on a page.
                    Sitting directly external to the border it is the region is which other HTML elements on a page are pushed away
                    An effective way to think of the margin is the yard of your house. It sits outside your walls, but other houses cannot be built there.
                </p>
                              
                
                <p>All of these elements work harmoniously to create a framework of elements. They each have different roles when setting up the visual features within a page </p>
