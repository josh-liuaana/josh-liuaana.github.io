            The best analogy is that of a house. 
            HTML is the builder, that’s where the framework of the house, at is bare bones, is created. You have walls, you have a roof etc. The house is up but there is nothing to give it any unique characteristics 
            That’s where CSS comes into it. Consider CSS as the designer. They come into your bare bones house and pick the wall colour, how big the tv is going to be and all the little visual features in your house.
            Finally, you have your JavaScript specialists coming through your house. Think electrician, plumbers and anyone who brings new interactive features to your house. What happens when I flick this switch? What happens if I pull this cord?
            
            Control flow and loops
            Control flow is the order that code is executed and runs in order from the first line in the file to the last line, unless conditionals or loops are introduced to change the flow
            Loops are used to repeat a particular set of code until a certain condition is met.
            Consider doing the dishes, there are a clear series of tasks that need to be completed in a certain order, run the water, get the dish soap etc. Think of the scrubbing phase like a loop, you can explain how to scrub (which is like an function in code, part of the control flow) but you need to make sure what you’re scrubbing is clean before you move on, this is where the loop comes in, where you need to keep repeating the ‘scrub’ function until the condition is met ‘clean plate’
            
            DOM – Document Object Model
            The DOM is a programming interface that represents HTML as a tree structure so that programs (JavaScript) can interact with it. We can then apply JavaScript functions to access and modify the code to provide and interactive experience
            
            Accessing data from array and objects
            An array is stores data in a ordered collection and this data is accessed by using the index within square bracket [i]
            An object is used to store properties that have differing keys and values. Square brackets or dot notation using the key can be used to access the value data
            
            
            Explain function and why they’re useful
            Functions are a section of code that provide instructions to perform a given task. They are useful in that once defined they can be re used throughout code for repeatable tasks
