            In 2015 I bought a pizza business and one the main things that needed to be discussed during the handover period was the status of all the current employees. This involves going over everyones strengths, weaknesses and general work habits etc. From there the decision was up to me whether to hire them, change pay structures or roles. During this process the previous owner raised concerns about two staff and encouraged me to not re hire them. This created a dilemma as it made me seriously consider my priorities and whether my goal was solely to make money, or whether the development of young staff was a high priority.
            This decision makes you think about what qualities were important to me and how I wanted to run a business moving forward. A value I have always thought I had was integrity and this situation tested that. I wanted the business to be a place where young people, often in their first jobs had a place to learn, feel comfortable and ultimately grow as both an employee and a person. Therefore, I decided that they deserved a chance and re hired them into similar roles, talked to then individually about what they wanted and how they feel they were treated before the takeover. Creating this dialogue made them feel comfortable and allowed them to be honest and ultimately led to me having a good relationship with them. Within the next year or two they had both learnt virtually everything, ending up in managerial roles and formed really good work habits and attitude.
            This experience helped shaped the way I approach some ethical dilemmas and that putting people first and trying to understand any problems they may be facing is vital for being a person who values honesty and integrity
            The culture I was raised in has always led me to put family (and friends) first. This led to Loyalty and Integrity being important core values for me, people being honest and holding themselves accountable. A quote I heard from a coach when I was young was "the name on the back of the shirt should never be more important than the badge on the front" perfectly describing that the success of the team is more important than individual pride. This is a cool life lesson that can be taken into any team situation, both sporting and in the working environment.
            Working in and managing a team always has obstacles and in certain instances people can have quite differing skill steps and processes. Working in hospitality for so many years has providing many of these experiences where clashes can occur. When creating different products during different times of the day sometimes the speed of work can greatly impact the success of a shift. Some people are better in high stress situations and some who tend to take more time due to wanting a perfect product can cause tense working relationships. These situations required me to understand these different methods and assign people in roles best suited to their skillsets to best benefit the team. By taking a step back and identifying how people operate I could put the faster people in the roles which required higher output and then place the perfectionists at the end of the chain to quality check. That way everyone is in a happy position without stepping on each other's toes.
            A similar technique works for most team environments, everyone has differing strengths and weaknesses and identifying these is important to operating efficiently. In situations when stress maybe isn't as high you can be more flexible with learning and teaching people different roles etc. but when the going gets tough sometimes its best just to play to your strengths

            A strength for me is my ability to work hard, I'm not afraid of long hours or serious grinds. However this can also be limitation for me as I have been prone to thinking that working 12 hour days is healthy. Learning to find the balanced between efficient work and long hours is a focus of mine, and something I will look to continue working on as I progress through my career. Problem-solving has been a strength for me, being able to approach tasks logically and break any issues down to find a solution
            A limitation that I have always had is being a bit of a perfectionist. It may be a competitive nature but I always want to be as proficient in anything I do. This can cause me to get very frustrated at a task that I may be struggling in which tends to make situations worse.
            I believe that with a good combination of hard work and problem solving abilities, any learning situation can be tackled successfully. Taking a step back will help for more trivial tasks and being able to grind it out will help for the more tedious situations
