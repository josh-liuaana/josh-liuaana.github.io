            What is emotional intelligence?
        </h4>
        <p>
            Emotional Intelligence is a personâ€™s ability to identify, understand and manage emotions in both themselves and others, and use this information to influence their expressions
            Emotional intelligence can be broken down into four elements
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Self-awareness</strong> - Being conscious of your own feeling and thoughts </li>
            <li><strong>Self-management</strong> - The ability to identify and control emotions, and behave in an appropriate manner</li>
            <li><strong>Social awareness</strong> - An ability to be empathetic and understand emotion in others</li>
            <li><strong>Relationship management</strong> - Being able to communicate, connect with others and facilitate a positive environment</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
            <h4>
                How is it different to IQ?
            </h4>
IQ is essentially a measure of ones reasoning ability, a quantifiable value of how well someone can use information and logic to make conclusions
EQ relates to a persons ability to perceive and express emotions, in the 4 elements stated above
            <h4>
                Why is it important?
            </h4>
Those with a higher emotional intelligence tend to communicate more effectively, create better mechanisms for coping with stress and enhance their abilities to create meaningful relationships with others
Someone with a greater emotional intelligence would find navigating sticky situations with people much easier. The ability to identify and manage relationships effectively is vital to creating healthy situations whether the be in your social life or work life. Effective communication and empathy are factors that will lead to a more efficient lifestyle and make all factors of life that much easier
