        <p> I have been blocked many many times recently, learning new things is not alwasy going to be straight forward and easy. I thought things weren't going to be too intense after learning about HTML and CSS.
            These seemed pretty simple and mastery would just take a little bit of time. Enter JavaScript, a true humble for the novice coder
            Manipulating objects and working simultaneously with other languages to create an interactive experience took a bit longer to wrap my head around.
            But as they say, good things take time, and I love a challenge. Getting stuck on relatively basic functions because notation is wrong or you have used the wrong syntax is a common error, and through time and practice I am slowly figuring out when a <code>';'</code> is right, how about a <code>':'</code> or even a <code>','</code>
            In this situation a bit of trial and error worked wonders in finding the notation. Practicing and repetition have helped and although I am by no means proficient, confidence levels are certainly on the up
            
        </p>
        
        <h3>Pseudocode</h3>
        <p>
            I may not pseudocode as effectively as I could, but this method definitely helps to explain code in plain english. This helps a novice like myself to understand the problem and approach it in an effective step by step manner
        </p>

        <h3>Trying something</h3>
        <p>
            Trial and error is a language I am proficient in. Generally the first step I take when I get stuck. It is definitely a process that ties in nicely with other problem solving techniques.
            If I do get stuck I will look at some documentation to see how a method is used and from there just chuck into my code and see what happens, and just go from there
        </p>
        
        <h3>Rubber ducky method</h3>
        <p>
            Although not to a rubber duck I practice this quite frequently. By sitting back, observing your code, talking about it, you often realise that an important step is missed, or wrong and therefore a solution can be attained from there.
        </p>
        
        <h3>Reading error messages</h3>
        <p>
            The one method I took for granted at first, considering that error messages will often tell you what and where a problem is, learning to interpret them is definitely something to get good at.
        </p>
        
        <h3>Console.logging</h3>
        <p>
            This is an elite level problem solving technique, using this has allowed me to see exactly what functions are producing and therefore what is going right or wrong. Using this alongside some trial and error has gotten me out of some messy situations
        </p>
        
        <h3>Googling</h3>
        <p>
            Google has been my best friends for many years, and our relationship is only growing stronger. My search history is now "JavaScript this", "JavaScript that", "CSS how do I  this". Seeing other code online and so many examples has helped me to understand how different methods work
        </p>
        
        <h3>Asking your peers for help</h3>
        <p>
            Something I dont do as much as I should, but seeing other people asking the same questions I have and then just following along the thread certainly helps. I think once we start working together in person, or when I create better relationships with people I will fell more confident asking for help
        </p>
        
        <h3>Asking coaches for help</h3>
        <p>
            Also something I dont do as much as I could, I feel like it would be a last resort. Going to peers first is good because it would also help them to reinforce their knowledge. I think once we hit bootcamp it will become more common because they will be right there, but for the time we are all learning together and the facilitators just seem like a cheat code because they are so guru.
        </p>
        
        <h3>Improving your process with reflection</h3>
        <p>
            I had never been one to reflect in the past, but these last few weeks have been really good. By taking a look at what you have completed and spending some time to think about it, it really solidifies what you are confident with and then identify what needs a bit more work.
            This has helped my to identify trends on what particular processes I struggle with and then go back and practice accordingly
