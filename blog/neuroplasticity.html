Effectively its understanding that your brain isn’t hard wired it is malleable, new pathways can be strengthened and unused can also fade away. The brains ability to adapt. The idea of Neuroplasticity mirrors that of the Growth mindset and understanding Neuroplasticity is the main step to having a growth mindset, knowing that the brain is not hardwired like a computer but is a process that allows the ability to learn, grow and ultimately reinvent yourself

Simply understanding the ideas of neuroplasticity help, knowing that your brain is not a fixed entity helped with growth. Neuroplasticity in adults is not as strong but the brain is still capable of change. Therefore its is vital that sustained effort is required, this mainly comes from forming good habit of practice to reinforce the new or dormant knowledge

            Practice, practice, practice.  Strengthening these pathways is the best way for new skills and knowledge to become solidified. We were told to code everyday and for good reason, by doing something consistently it strengthens the neural pathways. I have a background in sport and exercise and the principle is exactly the same for any muscle or skill. The more you practice the better you get. At face value it is a pretty simple concept but it is one that gets lost with the brain and new knowledge. Consistent and regular practice is key to reinforece these learnings into long term memory

the connections among the cells in our brains reorganize in response to our changing needs. This dynamic process allows us to learn from and adapt to different experiences” https://positivepsychology.com/neuroplasticity/

        <h4>
            Growth Mindset
        </h4>
        <p>
        Growth mindset vs fixed mindset – growth is understanding that knowledge, skills etc can be developed and strategies can be put into place to understand new concepts. Fixed mindset homies tend to have a narrow attitude of ‘nah ive always been bad at that’ and tend to stay locked into this mindset, ultimately locking themselves out of developing. The idea of celebrating the small wins is a good concept to consider, everything that is new or hard requires persistence and practice and therefore identifying steps to achieving a greater goal is beneficial for maintaining this growth mindset

        <h4>
        Did anything surprise me?
        </h4>
        <p>
        For me, understanding that because I have a pretty small understanding of development doesn’t mean I wont get better. At times it comes down to lowering standards and realizing that there is a process to learning and mastery takes time, which is fine. Being confident that I will understand the concepts if I accept the challenge, set myself goals and work towards these, then anything is impossible. Nothing is really surprising about this method, as a child quite often your told something along the lines of “you aren’t going to win thinking like that”. Personally for sport it was about never approaching a game or practice with a mindset of ‘you cant win’. Believing that immediately puts you on the back foot and makes anything harder and far less enjoyable. But the ‘having a crack’ attitude and being willing to learn and practice so you can improve healthy and is an encouragement of having a growth mindset

        Blend with learning plan and strategies
        </h4>
        <p><em><b>
        Go over learning plan, identify how neuroplasticity will factor in. One of the things that was discussed in the looping exercise is that struggling is natural and getting a defeatist mindset is just going to make things harder so staying positive I believe is a good coping mechanism
